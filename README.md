# UNSUPPORTED

Old practice project I was working on to utilize pokeAPI in typescript to create a pokedex. Idea is scrapped until further notice but code remains for now. It rendered all pokemon on a single page and I deemed it very ineffecient and did not like the UI direction I was taking it and will probably redesign it in the future when I can spare more time towards it.
