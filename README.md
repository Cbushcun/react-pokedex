#UNSUPPORTED

Old practice project I was working on to utilize pokeAPI in typescript to create a pokedex. Idea is scrapped until further notice but code remains for proof of experience. It renders all pokemon on a single page and I deemed it very ineffecient and did not like the UI direction I was taking it.
